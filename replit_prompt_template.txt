Create a clean, mobile-responsive, two-page website for the following local business:

• Business Name: [Extract from https://{domain} or "Client Name"]
• Business Type: {business_type} (e.g., "Plumbing Company")
• Location: {location} (e.g., "Dallas, TX")

Using the existing live site at https://{domain}, pull in all relevant content:
  – Main headline (H1) or business name
  – Service descriptions
  – Contact details (phone, address, email)
  – Logo or brand colors if available; if no logo exists, create a text-based logo using a modern font.

**Folder/File structure:**

/
├── index.html
├── blog.html
└── posts/       # ← empty folder; blog posts will go here later

---

### 1. Build `index.html` (Homepage)

Structure and content:

1. **Hero Section**
   – Business name or slogan as a large H1.
   – Single call-to-action button ("Call Now" or "Get a Free Quote") with `tel:` link.
   – Background or overlay image (use stock placeholder if none exists).

2. **About Section**
   – Short paragraph (2–3 sentences) describing the business or owner's background (pull from existing "About Us").
   – A bullet list "Why Choose Us" (e.g., "Licensed & Insured," "24/7 Emergency Service," "Over 15 Years of Experience").

3. **Services Section**
   – List core services (e.g., "Drain Cleaning," "Water Heater Repair").
   – For each service, include a 1–2 sentence description, pulled from the existing site.

4. **Testimonials / Trust Signals (Optional)**
   – If current site has customer reviews or star ratings, include 1–2. If none, omit.

5. **Contact Section**
   – Address (plain text), clickable phone number `<a href="tel:…">`.
   – Simple contact form placeholder (Name, Email/Phone, Message)—styled but non-functional.

6. **Footer**
   – "© [Current Year] [Business Name]"
   – Simple navigation links: Home, Blog, Services, Contact.

**Design Guidelines for `index.html`:**
• Use a modern sans-serif font (e.g., Montserrat or Open Sans).  
• Keep a light background and dark text for legibility.  
• Accent color: match existing brand color or use a complementary blue/teal if none exists.  
• CTA button must stand out (high-contrast).  
• All text size ≥ 16 px on mobile.  
• Use semantic HTML5 tags only (`<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`). Avoid deprecated tags (`<font>`, `<center>`, `<table>` for layout).

### 2. Build `blog.html` (Blog Index Page)

Structure and content:

1. **Header**  
   – `<h1>Blog</h1>`  
   – Subtitle: `<p>Latest news, tips, and updates from [Business Name]</p>`

2. **Post Listing**  
   – Use `<ol style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">`.  
   – Initially, include a placeholder:
     ```html
     <li>No posts yet. Check back soon!</li>
     ```
   – Future posts will be `posts/post-YYYY-MM-DD-title.html` and linked here.

3. **Navigation**  
   – Include a "Back to Home" link or nav bar linking to `index.html` and `blog.html`.

**Design Guidelines for `blog.html`:**
• Match header/footer styles and accent colors from `index.html`.  
• Center content in a container (`max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px`).  
• Each post link (when added) appears as:
  ```html
  <li>
    <a href="posts/post-2024-07-05-how-to-avoid-drain-clogs.html">How to Avoid Drain Clogs This Summer</a>
    <span style="color: #666;">(July 5, 2024)</span>
  </li>
  ```

### 3. Create /posts/ Folder

Simply generate an empty directory named posts/.
No files inside initially. Future blog posts go here (name format: post-YYYY-MM-DD-title.html).

posts/
  └── (empty)
